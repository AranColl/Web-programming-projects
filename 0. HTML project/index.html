            <p>Welcome my beloved viewers! <br>
              My name is Phileas Fogg. I am a young web designer who recently went on holidays. I only have 80 days before I have to go back to work, and since I have been
              gathering some money lately, I have decided to go visit some countries. I don't really know where my journey is going to take me, maybe I finish travelling all
              around the world, who knows.</p>

              <p>Oporto. One of the most beautiful cities in Portugal, and I dare to say in Europe. This was the first stop of my incredible trip to Europe and it was
              totally worth it. The history of a Port that ends up as a city and a portuguese symbol. Oporto is a must if you ever think of travelling to Europe and their
              cuisine won't disappoint our most exquisite chefs. Eu amo Portugal!</p>

              <p>Barcelona. If you imagine have ever imagined a perfect city, well Barcelona goes beyond. Nice weather throughout all year, awesome people and culture,
                and I have just started. The city itself is amazing. Some neighbourhoods are even grid structured and activities are being held all the time for everyone.
                Certainly, the city I will be living for the rest of my life. Estimo Barcelona! </p>
