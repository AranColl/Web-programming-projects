        <h3> Oporto </h3>

            <p> An orangish sunlight enlightened the arrival to Oporto, the only portuguese city I would visit. My apartment was not far from the airport and
            I was decided to start my journey, but not before having breakfast. My place was in a perfect location I even had sea views. Awesome welcoming.
            But I had no time to procrastinate, and I rushed to the city center, the free tour was about to start. 3 hours walking may seem tedious, unless someone
            like Kayli takes you throughout the history of Oporto. Travelling is the better way to get to learn new ideologies, cultures and people, but we don't have
            to be satisfied at this stage and we need dive in-depth within. At the end we are all human beings and our natural behaviour is changed by the things we see and
            imitate from the people that surround us, and sometimes to understand some of our unconscious behaviour is by studying our past. That is, why I enjoy the most
            visiting a city with someone explaining not only their history but also their traditions and lifestyle. And Kayli was the best doing that.The Oporto Cathedral,
            Saint Nicholas church, Clérigos Church and Tower would be "only buildings" if it hadn't been from her. The tour finished, and I was starving hence it was time to have a
            taste of the portuguese cuisine. And it is delicious. The meal names were interesting, but I have learned to step outside my comfort zone and try new exotic foods
            all around the world (understanding different lifestyles' idea again). I headed to the city center and spent there my afternoon, talking to some locals. It was quite
            late and after another incredible meal I decided to get some rest, on the next day I was taking a bus to Barcelona, and I'd rather be energetic.
            Before falling asleep I thought about Oporto. What a beautiful city! I would definitely live here.</p>

            <p> Once on the bus, I decided to do some research on Portuguese cuisine. For lunch, I had what looked like a vegetarian sandwich with cheese on top and a
              mysterious sauce all around. I am pretty sure it was called ... </p>
