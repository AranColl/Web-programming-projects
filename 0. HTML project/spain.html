            <p> An orangish sunlight enlightened my bus arrival to Barcelona, the only spanish city I would visit. My apartment was not far from the coach station and
            I was decided to start my journey, but not before having breakfast. My place was in a perfect location I even had sea views. Awesome welcoming.
            But I had no time to procrastinate, and I rushed to the city center, the free tour was about to start. 3 hours walking may seem tedious, unless someone
            like Kayli takes you throughout the history of Barcelona. Travelling is the better way to get to learn new ideologies, cultures and people, but we don't have
            to be satisfied at this stage and we need dive in-depth within. At the end we are all human beings and our natural behaviour is changed by the things we see and
            imitate from the people that surround us, and sometimes to understand some of our unconscious behaviour is by studying our past. That is, why I enjoy the most
            visiting a city with someone explaining not only their history but also their traditions and lifestyle. And Kayli was the best doing that.
            The Casa Batlló, Sagrada Familia, Torre Agbar, and Plaça Catalunya would be "only buildings" if it hadn't been from her. The tour finished,
            and I was starving hence it was time to have a taste of the catalan cuisine. And it is delicious. The meal names were interesting, but I have learned to
            step outside my comfort zone and try new exotic foods all around the world (understanding different lifestyles' idea again). I headed to the city center and spent there
            my afternoon, talking to some locals. It was quite late and after another incredible meal I decided to get some rest, on the next day I was taking a bus to Marseille, and
            I'd rather be energetic. Before falling asleep I thought about Barcelona. What a beautiful city! I would definitely live here.</p>

            <p> Once on the bus, I decided to do some research on Pablo Picasso, a Spanish painter known worldwide. He is widely known as a co-founder of the cubist movement. He was
              born in Malaga, the south of Spain, but spent most of his life in France. Among all his paintings and sculptures, there are two I really like: </p>
