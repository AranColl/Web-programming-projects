SOCIAL NETWORK PROJECT

In this django project, a social network website is 
implemented. In this website, users are allowed
 to make posts, follow other users, and “like” posts.
 
 To make it run, once inside the folder, you run the:
'python manage.py runserver' command.

You can see a video showing the applications of the website
